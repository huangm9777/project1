            <p>The opening animation of the page is very characteristic, but the animation jumps a little fast, and the text in it jumps to the next page before it is finished reading.After entering the home page, the navigation bar is a little bit less. The content of the home page is a little confusing, and I don't know what I want to show, but the overall layout is good.Also, if you want to go back to the beginning of the animation, you have to go back to the home page and then click on the logo in the navigation bar, which is a little hard to find.</p>

            This page mainly shows people some information about Chinese New Year.I made a few pages to introduce some Chinese Spring Festival dishes and some of the main festivals during this period.This includes a lot of pictures and text to show you, but also a few videos.
