    <p>Grand Theft Auto is a 1997 action-adventure game developed by DMA Design and published by BMG Interactive. It is the first instalment of the Grand Theft Auto series, and has led to five main entries and several spinoff games over 16 years, selling more than 150 million units as of September 2013. The story follows a group of criminals in three fictionalised versions of US cities as they perform bank robberies, assassinations, and other illegal activities for their respective crime syndicates. It was first released in Europe in October 1997 for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. It was later re-released in December 1997 in Europe and June 1998 in North America for the PlayStation.

      The game was originally intended to be named Race'n'Chase and to be developed for the Commodore Amiga, starting in 1996. However, it was nearly cancelled due to production issues.
      
      Its successor, Grand Theft Auto 2, was released in October 1999.</p>
